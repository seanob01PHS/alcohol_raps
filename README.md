# RAP (Reproducible Analytical Pipeline) for alcohol harms outputs.
### Author: [Sean O'Brien](mailto:sean.obrien@phs.scot)

This project combines previous extract scripts witten by [Gary King](mailto:gary.king@phs.scot) and [Kwaku Osei-Oppong](mailto:Kwaku.Osei-Oppong@phs.scot) with scripts that generate flexdashboard outputs written by Sean O'Brien.
The goal is to produce ready-to-send html output with minimal initial input.

The initial extract code needed wrapped in functions in order to be used as desired, and it is useful to have all the scripts within this project folder. Thus, a substantial ammount of code-copying has occured. The relevant initial authors have been cited at the top of each script.
