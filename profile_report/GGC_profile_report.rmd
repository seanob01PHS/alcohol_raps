### General Notes

#### **Alcohol Harms Report**
#### **NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde**
##### Report date: `r format(Sys.time(), "%d %b %Y")`

<br/>

The tables in the **Profile** page shows information at interzone level for various alcohol related harms indicators.

(1) **Alcohol Specific Deaths:** the time periods for this indicator are 3 calendar year aggregates.
(2) **Alcohol-related mental health admissions:** the time periods for this indicator are 3 financial year aggregates.
(3) **Alcohol-related hospital admissions:** the time periods for this indicator are single financial years.

### Profile Notes {data-icon="fa-table"}

#### **Alcohol Harms Report**
#### **NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde**
#### Information for using the profile page

<br/>

The profile page is intended to give an overview of the alcohol related harms indicators for HSCPs and Interzones (IZs).  
The two tables under the tabs **HSCP profile** and **IZ Profile** show EASR rates (per 10,000 population) for the indicators and the respective rate of change of those indicators compared to the previous period.

<br/>

##### **HSCP Profile**

This table shows rates and rates of change of indicators for the HSCPs within NHS GGC and for NHS GGC and Scotland as a whole.

- Click the download button to export the data shown in **HSCP Profile** as an excel table.
- The table will include red circles \ <span style="color: #B8100D"> `r shiny::icon("circle")` </span> \ next to data that signify if that HSCP is in the 75^th^ percentile or above for all NHS GGC HSCPs

<br/>


##### **IZ Profile**

This table shows rates and rates of change of indicators for all IZs within NHS GGC.

- Use the HSCP selector at the top of the page or the search bars above the two leftmost columns to filter the data.
- Note that selecting **(All)** in the HSCP selector does not function as it should. To return to the unfiltered view, delete anything in the filter box using backspace.


Since there are many rows in **IZ Profile** the user is left to select which rows they wish to download. Downloading all rows is still possible.  

- Select a row using the tick-boxes on the left to add it to the rows for which you would like to download the displayed data.
- Initially all rows are selected and you cannot select zero rows.
- Change to the **Profile Download** tab to show all the rows that are to be downloaded and click on your selected format to start the download.
- The download data is in a wide format where the additional details are new columns in the data.  

Like with the **HSCP profile**, this profile also shows red circles to indicate rows in a high percentile of the data.   

- In the initial view there will be red circles \ <span style="color: #B8100D"> `r shiny::icon("circle")` </span> \ that signify if that value is in the 75^th^ percentile or above for all IZs in NHS GGC.
- Once the data is filtered, an open red circle \ <span style="color: #B8100D"> `r shiny::icon("circle-o")` </span> \ will also be shown to signify if that value is in the 75^th^ percentile or above for the filtered data. If you filter for a specific HSCP this will help identify outliers within that HSCP.

<br/>

**The following applies to both profile tables**

- Click on the column headers to sort by that column ascending and again to sort descending.  

- The value columns are coloured based on the relative values in that column:
    + <span class="larger_smaller_nums" style="background-color: #EAC43A">larger numbers</span> 
    + <span class="larger_smaller_nums" style="background-color: #FBF4DA">smaller numbers</span>
- The rate of change columns are coloured based on the relative positive (+ve) or negative (-ve) values in that column:
    + <span class="larger_smaller_nums" style="background-color: #d26146">large +ve change</span> 
    + <span class="larger_smaller_nums" style="background-color: #EFC6BD">small +ve change</span>
    + <span class="larger_smaller_nums" style="background-color: #DBECC1">small -ve change</span> 
    + <span class="larger_smaller_nums" style="background-color: #9CC951">large -ve change</span>
    + The rate of change columns also have arrows \ \ 
<span style="color: #B8100D"> `r shiny::icon("arrow-up")` </span> \ 
<span style="color: #71B109"> `r shiny::icon("arrow-down")` </span> \  
<span style="color: #F4E61F"> `r shiny::icon("grip-lines")` </span> \ \ 
corresponding to +ve, -ve and zero change.  
    + A dash -- in the rate of change column indicates that the previous value was zero so no relative change can be calculated.   



- Click on the black triangle at the start of each row to display more details
    - Comparisons in rates relative to Scotland and NHS GGC. The cells for this are coloured to the same scheme as the rate of change columns.
    - The most recent population of that intermediate zone.
